# Arrest Manager+

This is RelaperCrystal's fork of the original Arrest Manager project after the project itself was left alone for nearly two years.

**To be clear, this name is temponary. The code is no longer related to arrest - More Jail Points and Prisoner Transporter features has been removed. I plans to rename the project.**

Currently, I'm working on how to remove references from Albo1125.Common library from this project.

## About Code

You should be able to actually read the code easier as I cleaned a lot of codes as well as warnings. I'm actually shocked by how bad Albo1125 codes back then - thousand of warnings, and it's even worse that I uses SolarLint and Roslynator. However, I managed to get rid of most of them.

> I know, I know, the code is FAR from perfect. This project sprung into life when I started learning C# and it originally started off as just a bit of toying around in my first ever object-oriented programming language. Who remembers the More Jail Points and then the More Jail Points & Prisoner Transporter days? Yes, much of that (abysmal but functional) code remains today.
